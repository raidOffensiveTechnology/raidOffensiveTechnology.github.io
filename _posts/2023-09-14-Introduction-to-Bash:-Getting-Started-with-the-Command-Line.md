# Introduction to Bash: Getting Started with the Command Line

Bash (AKA Bourne Again Shell) is the basic language to communicate with a computer.

## Installation
### macOS
macOS already has Bash installed. Access it via the Terminal app, in the "Utilities" folder in your launchpad.

### Windows
Windows is a bit more complicated. Bash is not pre-installed, but rather Powershell.
Visit [gitforwindows.com](https://gitforwindows.org/), and press download.
You will be redirected to a website called Github (which we'll cover a lot later on), and select the appropriate file for you.
> For 99% of scenarios, use "Git_X.XX.X.X-64-bit.exe".
{: .prompt-tip }
Once installed, just right click anywhere (on your Desktop for example) and click "Git Bash Here", and a terminal should pop up.

### Linux
All linux distributions have Bash pre-installed, as it is the preferred language for hackers, but if in any case you don't have it:
On Ubuntu based systems:
```
sudo apt install bash
```

On Red-Hat based systems:
```
sudo yum install bash
```
