Our morals
==========

*   We believe that disclosing weaknesses in a system is a must to help improve the system itself
*   We believe it is wrong to hack with the intention of monetary gain
*   We believe it is wrong for a company/organization to keep originally free software behind a paywall
*   We believe it is an obligation to give credit where credit is due
